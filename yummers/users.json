","Gently fold the meringue into the batter until there are no more white streaks.","Make sure you start your folds from the bottom so that the batter at the bottom of the bowl doesn't go unmixed. You need to be gentle when folding. If you mix too hard, the meringue will lose its structure.","Once the meringue has been incorporated, add in another third.","Fold in. And then the final third. At the end, you batter should be very light and airy, with the meringue only just incorporated to the point where there are not visible white streaks.","Add two ring molds to a large skillet.
